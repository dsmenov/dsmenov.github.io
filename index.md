## Hello, my Friend

I’m **Dmytro Smenov**.

I am a DevOps Engineer with Entrepreneur DNA.

Born in Ukraine and currently living in Poland, I have navigated both cultural and technical landscapes to build a career defined by adaptability.

My values:

- While my hands are on the keyboard automating pipelines and stabilizing infrastructure, my mind is focused on the bigger picture: **How does this technology drive the business forward?**

- I bridge that gap. **I don't just fix problems; I optimize systems** to reduce costs, increase speed, and mitigate risk-thinking like a founder, not just an employee.
